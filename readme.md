The DIVAs (Dynamic Information Visualization of Agent systems) project aims at developing generic reusable components 
and libraries that can be instantiated and integrated to create decentralized agent-based simulation systems where agents
are situated in open (i.e., inaccessible, non-deterministic, dynamic and continuous) environments.

As a software development framework, DIVAs encompasses concepts, architecture, abstract classes, software components and libraries.

This large-scale project was started several years ago and has gone through multiple iterations. The various internal 
releases allowed the definition, refinement and prototyping of the fundamental concepts and building blocks of the framework.
The latest baselined version is DIVAs 4.

DIVAs 4 provides JAVA programmers with the components necessary to build executable agent-based simulation systems. 
Based on sound software engineering principles (i.e., separation of concerns, modularity, information hiding), Divas has a flexible and
extensible, “plug-in” architecture whose components can be instantiated and reused to develop various
multi-agent simulation systems. The framework is fully implemented in Java and is based on state-of-the-art enterprise-scale 
technologies (e.g., ActiveMQ , jMonkey, JavaFX).
